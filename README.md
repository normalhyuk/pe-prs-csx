## Data Source (GWAS summary statistics)
To generate enhanced cross-ancestry-based PRS with transferability, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from three worldwide biobanks, including the FinnGen Consortium (n=173,746; EUR), UKBB (n=220,617; EUR), and BioBank Japan (BBJ) (n=82,085; Asian), were used.

## PRS Generation
PRS for PE was constructed using the Bayesian cross-ancestry polygenic prediction method, PRS-CSx (extension version of PRS-CS), which infers the posterior mean effect size of each variant using linkage disequilibrium reference panels by population and GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations. 19,20 The individual PRSs were computed from beta coefficients as the weighted sum of the risk alleles using PLINK 1.90 with the score command. 21
